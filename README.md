### My name is Jinyoung Ko, a Building Scientist interested in *Human-Building Interaction*. 

🌱 I'm a PhD student in Civil Engineering (Building Science) at the University of Toronto & Intelligent and Interactive Buildings LAB (advisor: [Dr. Seungjae Lee](https://hab.civmin.utoronto.ca/people/dr-seungjae-lee/)). I hold a Master of Science in Architectural Engineering under the supervision of [Dr. Jae-Weon Jeong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9o_3FZ4AAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao/) at Hanyang University, after graduating my undergraduate as *Summa Cum Laude* in Architectural Engineering at Hanyang University as well.

I am interested in studying how occupants interact with buildings through indoor environments and interfaces. If you are interested in  myself, please look into my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11gRWusAPum5zXh4VHKVGbVvyxIKVRtqB/view?usp=sharing).
